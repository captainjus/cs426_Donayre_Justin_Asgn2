<b>Executive Summary</b>
In the 21st century, cute little birds create a PC in a huge forest. “PC Building for Bird Games” is a scavenger networking game, where all players are birds. They help collect computer parts to build a PC in a forest, this game is available in Windows targeted for children ages 6 to 14. 

<b>Formal Elements:</b>
Intelligent birds known as “birdbrains” find PC parts scattered around the forest. In order to build the PC, they have found a book on how to build a PC. They think to themselves, “Why build nests? We can build our own computer!”

<p>The procedure of our game is strictly limited only to the forest and players cannot leave; the forest is bounded by walls. The bird can fly; however, the bird has a stamina bar located on the top right corner of the screen. Our game is recommending 2-4 players. They have a limited amount of time to gather and find all the computer objects. The players can only hold one object at a time and must return the object back to the nest located at their spawn location. Once all the parts are returned to the nest before the time ends (with the help of each player in game), the players win. Otherwise, they lose and could restart the game.</p>
